## Prerequisites (if only required)

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- An NVIDIA GPU with a compatible CUDA Toolkit.
- The appropriate NVIDIA drivers for your GPU.
- Conda (or Miniconda) for environment management.

## Installation (you can start from here)

Follow these steps to set up the necessary environment and dependencies.

1. **Create and Activate a Conda Environment**

   ```bash
   # Create a conda environment
   conda env create -f environment.yml

   # Activate the new environment
   conda activate GET
   ```
  > **Note:** If you encounter package conflicts, we recommend creating a fresh environment before proceeding. 


2. **Verify the Installation**

   Run the following command to confirm that PyTorch was installed correctly and can detect your GPU.

   ```bash
   python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch Version: {torch.__version__}'); print(f'CUDA Available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
   ```

   The expected output should show your `PyTorch version` and `CUDA Available: True`. If it returns `False`, please verify your NVIDIA driver and CUDA Toolkit installation.

## Dataset Preparation

- **BUS**: Breast Ultrasound Dataset. Download from [MMU Docm](http://www2.docm.mmu.ac.uk/STAFF/M.Yap/dataset.php) (Yap et al.)  
- **BUSI**: Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset. Download from [CU Scholar](https://scholar.cu.edu.eg/?q=afahmy/pages/dataset) (Al-Dhabyani et al.)  
- **GlaS**: Gland Segmentation Challenge Dataset. Download from [Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/tia/data/glascontest/) (Sirinukunwattana et al.) OR [Another link](https://academictorrents.com/details/208814dd113c2b0a242e74e832ccac28fcff74e5) 
- **HAM10000**: Skin Lesion Analysis Dataset. Download from [Harvard Dataverse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DBW86T) (Tschandl et al.)  
- **Kvasir-Instrument**: Endoscopic Instrument Dataset. Download from [Simula Data](https://datasets.simula.no/kvasir-instrument/) (Jha et al.)  

The expected directory structure is as follows:

```
Dataset/
├── bus/
│   ├── bus_train_test_names.pkl      # Defines train/test splits
│   ├── images/
│   └── masks/
├── busi/
│   ├── busi_train_test_names.pkl
│   ├── images/
│   └── masks/
├── glas/
│   ├── glas_train_test_names.pkl
│   ├── images/
│   └── masks/
├── ham10000/
│   ├── ham10000_train_test_names.pkl
│   ├── images/
│   └── masks/
└── kvasir-instrument/
    ├── kvasir_train_test_names.pkl
    ├── images/
    └── masks/
```

You can inspect the predefined training and testing splits using our helper script:

```bash
python Dataset/show_pkl_content.py
```

## Training & Inference

### Training

To train the GET model on a dataset select which one you are going to train from `train.sh`, then run the training script:

```bash
sh train.sh
```

- Model checkpoints and logs will be saved to the `Results/` directory.
- Hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and epochs can be modified in the corresponding YAML configuration files located in `configs/` (e.g., `configs/bus_train.yaml`).

> **Hardware Note:** The default batch size is set to `8`, which is optimized for a 24GB GPU like the NVIDIA 3090 Ti. If you encounter an out-of-memory (OOM) error, please reduce the `batch_size` in the configuration file.

### Inference

To evaluate a trained model and generate segmentation masks, put the trained model into the `valid_dataset_name` (e.g., valid_bus, valid_busi) folder and do other configurations (e.g., `configs/bus_valid.yaml`) like training, then run the validation script:

```bash
sh valid.sh
```

This will produce the following outputs:

- **Predicted Masks:** Saved in the `Results/valid_dataset_name` (e.g., Results/valid_bus) directory.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** A `results.csv` file containing Dice Score (DSC), Intersection over Union (IoU), and 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95) for each test image.
